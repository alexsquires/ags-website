    <h1>Hi, I'm Alex.</h1>
    <p>
    I'm a Ph.D. student in the Chemistry department at the University of Bath. My current research interests center around understanding doping, defects and disoder in current and next-generation energy storage materials. I'm supervised by Dr. Benjamin Morgan, and my work is loosely affiliated with the UK's battery research consortium, The Faraday Institution.

    <p>
    Before coming to Bath, I recieved my M.Sci degree in Chemistry at University College London.
